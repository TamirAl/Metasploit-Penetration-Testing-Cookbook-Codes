Guidelines for running command lines – Chapter 1

Here I will explain the setup that is required to run the commands mentioned in the book. I have divided this documentation according to the recipes. 
Configuring Metasploit on Ubuntu 
To execute the command lines mentioned in this chapter we will require ubuntu operating system installed. 
We can start the terminal window and pass on the commands to execute them. Also we will need a downloaded copy of metasploit framework for Linux. For this recipe we are considering that we have version 4 of metasploit framework.
The command lines used in this recipe are
$ chmod +x framework-4.*-linux-full.run
$ sudo ./framework-4.*-linux-full.run 


$ chmod +x framework-4.*-linux-mini.run
$ sudo ./framework-4.*-linux-mini.run

$ sudo apt-get install ruby libopenssl-ruby libyaml-ruby libdl-ruby     libiconv-ruby libreadline-ruby irb ri rubygems

$ sudo apt-get install subversion

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential ruby-dev libpcap-dev

$ tar xf framework-4.X.tar.gz
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/metasploit4
$ sudo cp -a msf4/ /opt/metasploit3/msf4
$ sudo chown root:root -R /opt/metasploit4/msf4
$ sudo ln -sf /opt/metasploit3/msf3/msf* /usr/local/bin/


 


Metasploit with BackTrack 5 – The Ultimate combination
This recipe will need an installed copy of BackTrack 5 operating system. It will not require downloading metasploit framework as Backtrack OS comes pre-installed with metasploit.
The command lines used in this recipe are:
The metasploit command line console or msfconsole can be started by following the listed path on the Backtrack desktop : Applications > Exploitation Tools > Metasploit > Framework
The commands mentioned in this recipe will require launching the terminal window in BT5 OS. The commands are :
root@bt:~# cd /pentest/exploits/framework3
root@bt:/pentest/exploits/framework3 ~# ./msfconsole

These commands will have to be executed from the terminal window in order to start the msfconsole.

Connecting Metasploit on virtual machine with SSH connectivity
The commands mentioned in this recipe can also be executed directly from the terminal of BackTrack OS. The commands used are:
root@bt:~# /etc/init.d/start ssh 
root@bt:~# start ssh

root@bt:~# ifconfig


Beginning with Interfaces- The “hello world” of metasploit 
The commands mentioned in this recipe can be executed directly from the Backtrack terminal and needs no other installation. The commands used are:
root@bt:~# cd /pentest/exploits/framework3

root@bt:/pentest/exploits/framework3# ./msfconsole


msf > ls
msf > help
msf > msfupdate

Setting up the database in Metasploit
The following commands have to be executed directly from the Backtrack console
root@bt:~# cd /opt/framework3/config

root@bt:/opt/framework3/config# cat database.yml

The next set of commands will be executed from the msfconsole. Msfconsole can be launched by navigating through : Applications > Exploitation Tools > Metasploit > Framework > msfconsole
Once the msfconsole starts we will find that the terminal now lists as msf> .
Now we can execute the other commands of this recipe.

msf > db_driver
Msf> db_driver mysql

msf > db_connect msf3:8b826ac0@127.0.0.1:7175/msf3

msf> gem install postgres
msf> apt-get install libpq-dev 

msf> db_destroy msf3:8b826ac0@127.0.0.1:7175/msf3


Using database to store Penetration testing results

The commands mentioned in this recipe will be executed from the msfconsole. Msfconsole can be launched by navigating through : Applications > Exploitation Tools > Metasploit > Framework > msfconsole
The commands include:
msf > db_nmap 192.168.56.102

msf > nmap 192.168.56.102 –A -oX report





Analysing the stored results of the database

The commands mentioned in this recipe will be executed from the msfconsole. Msfconsole can be launched by navigating through : Applications > Exploitation Tools > Metasploit > Framework > msfconsole
The commands used are:
msf > hosts address,os_name
msf > hosts -c 
msf > services
msf > vulns

Msf > db_autopwn
